55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,24,1,0
55,"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,25,1,0
55,"Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,26,1,0
55,"house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,27,1,0
55,"many miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,28,1,0
55,"room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,29,1,0
55,"the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,30,1,0
55,"and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,31,1,0
55,"another corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,32,1,0
55,"small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,33,1,0
55,"could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,34,1,0
55,crush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,35,1,0
55,"middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,36,1,0
55,hole.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,37,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,37,1,1
55,"When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,38,1,1
55,nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,39,1,1
55,house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,40,1,1
55,the sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,41,1,1
55,"gray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,42,1,1
55,"not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,43,1,1
55,they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,44,1,1
55,"had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,45,1,1
55,"it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,46,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,46,1,1
55,"When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.  The sun",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,47,1,1
55,"and wind had changed her, too.  They had taken the sparkle from her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,48,1,1
55,eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,49,1,1
55,"and lips, and they were gray also.  She was thin and gaunt, and never",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,50,1,1
55,"smiled now.  When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,51,1,1
55,Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,52,1,1
55,and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,53,1,1
55,reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,54,1,1
55,that she could find anything to laugh at.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,55,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,55,1,1
55,Uncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,56,1,1
55,"did not know what joy was.  He was gray also, from his long beard to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,57,1,1
55,"his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,58,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,58,1,1
55,"It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,59,1,1
55,as her other surroundings.  Toto was not gray; he was a little black,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,60,1,1
55,"dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,61,1,1
55,"either side of his funny, wee nose.  Toto played all day long, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,62,1,1
55,"Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,63,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,63,1,1
55,"Today, however, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry sat upon the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,64,1,1
55,"doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,65,1,1
55,"usual.  Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,66,1,1
55,the sky too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,67,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,67,1,1
55,"From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,68,1,1
55,and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,69,1,1
55,coming storm.  There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,70,1,1
55,"south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,71,1,1
55,grass coming from that direction also.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,72,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,72,1,1
55,Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,73,1,1
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,73,1,1
55,"""There's a cyclone coming, Em,"" he called to his wife.  ""I'll go look",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,74,1,2
55,"after the stock.""  Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,75,1,2
55,horses were kept.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,76,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,76,1,2
55,Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance told her of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,77,1,2
55,the danger close at hand.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,78,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,78,1,2
55,"""Quick, Dorothy!"" she screamed.  ""Run for the cellar!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,79,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,79,1,2
55,"Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,80,1,2
55,"started to get him.  Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,81,1,2
55,"door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,82,1,2
55,hole.  Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,83,1,2
55,When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,84,1,2
55,"wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,85,1,2
55,down suddenly upon the floor.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,86,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,86,1,2
55,Then a strange thing happened.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,87,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,87,1,2
55,The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,88,1,2
55,air.  Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,89,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,89,1,2
55,"The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,90,1,2
55,exact center of the cyclone.  In the middle of a cyclone the air is,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,91,1,2
55,"generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,92,1,2
55,"the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,93,1,2
55,of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,94,1,2
55,away as easily as you could carry a feather.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,95,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,95,1,2
55,"It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,96,1,2
55,"found she was riding quite easily.  After the first few whirls around,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,97,1,2
55,"and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,98,1,2
55,"being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,99,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,99,1,2
55,"Toto did not like it.  He ran about the room, now here, now there,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,100,1,2
55,barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,101,1,2
55,see what would happen.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,102,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,102,1,2
55,"Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,103,1,2
55,the little girl thought she had lost him.  But soon she saw one of his,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,104,1,2
55,"ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,105,1,2
55,"was keeping him up so that he could not fall.  She crept to the hole,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,106,1,2
55,"caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,107,1,2
55,closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,108,1,2
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,108,1,2
55,"Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,109,1,2
55,"but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,110,1,2
55,her that she nearly became deaf.  At first she had wondered if she,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,111,1,3
55,would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,112,1,3
55,"passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,113,1,3
55,to wait calmly and see what the future would bring.  At last she,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,114,1,3
55,"crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,115,1,3
55,Toto followed and lay down beside her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,116,1,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,116,1,3
55,"In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,117,1,3
55,Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,118,1,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,118,1,3

55,2.  The Council with the Munchkins,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,119,2,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,119,2,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,119,2,3
55,"She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,120,2,3
55,"not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt.  As it was,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,121,2,3
55,the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,122,2,3
55,Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,123,2,3
55,Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,124,2,3
55,"dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,125,2,3
55,little room.  She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,126,2,3
55,and opened the door.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,127,2,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,127,2,3
55,"The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,128,2,3
55,growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,129,2,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,129,2,3
55,The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,130,2,3
55,midst of a country of marvelous beauty.  There were lovely patches of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,131,2,3
55,"greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,132,2,3
55,"fruits.  Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,133,2,3
55,rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,134,2,3
55,"A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,135,2,3
55,"green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,136,2,3
55,"who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,137,2,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,137,2,3
55,"While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,138,2,3
55,she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,139,2,3
55,ever seen.  They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,140,2,3
55,"used to; but neither were they very small.  In fact, they seemed about",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,141,2,3
55,"as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,142,2,3
55,"they were, so far as looks go, many years older.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,143,2,3
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,143,2,3
55,"Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed.  They wore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,144,2,3
55,"round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,145,2,3
55,little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,146,2,3
55,"hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,147,2,3
55,wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders.  Over it were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,148,2,4
55,sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,149,2,4
55,"men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,150,2,4
55,"well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.  The men,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,151,2,4
55,"Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,152,2,4
55,beards.  But the little woman was doubtless much older.  Her face was,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,153,2,4
55,"covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,154,2,4
55,stiffly.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,155,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,155,2,4
55,When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,156,2,4
55,"doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,157,2,4
55,"come farther.  But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,158,2,4
55,"low bow and said, in a sweet voice:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,159,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,159,2,4
55,"""You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,160,2,4
55,We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,161,2,4
55,"East, and for setting our people free from bondage.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,162,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,162,2,4
55,Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.  What could the little,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,163,2,4
55,"woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,164,2,4
55,"killed the Wicked Witch of the East?  Dorothy was an innocent, harmless",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,165,2,4
55,"little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,166,2,4
55,and she had never killed anything in all her life.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,167,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,167,2,4
55,"But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,168,2,4
55,"with hesitation, ""You are very kind, but there must be some mistake.  I",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,169,2,4
55,"have not killed anything.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,170,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,170,2,4
55,"""Your house did, anyway,"" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,171,2,4
55,"""and that is the same thing.  See!"" she continued, pointing to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,172,2,4
55,"corner of the house.  ""There are her two feet, still sticking out from",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,173,2,4
55,"under a block of wood.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,174,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,174,2,4
55,"Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright.  There, indeed, just",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,175,2,4
55,"under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,176,2,4
55,"sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,177,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,177,2,4
55,"""Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!"" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,178,2,4
55,"dismay.  ""The house must have fallen on her.  Whatever shall we do?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,179,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,179,2,4
55,"""There is nothing to be done,"" said the little woman calmly.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,180,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,180,2,4
55,"""But who was she?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,181,2,4
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,181,2,4
55,"""She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,"" answered the little",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,182,2,4
55,"woman.  ""She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,183,2,4
55,"making them slave for her night and day.  Now they are all set free,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,184,2,4
55,"and are grateful to you for the favor.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,185,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,185,2,5
55,"""Who are the Munchkins?"" inquired Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,186,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,186,2,5
55,"""They are the people who live in this land of the East",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,187,2,5
55," where the Wicked Witch ruled.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,188,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,188,2,5
55,"""Are you a Munchkin?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,189,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,189,2,5
55,"""No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,190,2,5
55,When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,191,2,5
55,"messenger to me, and I came at once.  I am the Witch of the North.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,192,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,192,2,5
55,"""Oh, gracious!"" cried Dorothy.  ""Are you a real witch?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,193,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,193,2,5
55,"""Yes, indeed,"" answered the little woman.  ""But I am a good witch, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,194,2,5
55,the people love me.  I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,195,2,5
55,"ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,196,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,196,2,5
55,"""But I thought all witches were wicked,"" said the girl, who was half",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,197,2,5
55,"frightened at facing a real witch.  ""Oh, no, that is a great mistake.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,198,2,5
55,"There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,199,2,5
55,"those who live in the North and the South, are good witches.  I know",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,200,2,5
55,"this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,201,2,5
55,"Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,202,2,5
55,"but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,203,2,5
55,"in all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,204,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,204,2,5
55,"""But,"" said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, ""Aunt Em has told me",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,205,2,5
55,"that the witches were all dead--years and years ago.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,206,2,5
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,206,2,5

55,"you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,216,2,5

55,"the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,296,3,8
55,"She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,297,3,8

55,"dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,310,3,8
55,her head.  She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,311,3,8
55,"cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top.  Then she looked down at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,312,3,8
55,her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,313,3,8
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,313,3,8

55,"briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,331,3,8

55,"painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,338,3,9
55,vegetables in abundance.  Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,339,3,9

55,everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,342,3,9
55,setting them free from bondage.  The houses of the Munchkins were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,343,3,9
55,"odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,344,3,9

55,with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,379,3,10
55,"greatly amused Dorothy.  Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,380,3,10

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,466,4,12
55,"After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,467,4,12
55,"difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,468,4,12
55,"which were here very uneven.  Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,469,4,12
55,"missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,470,4,12
55,"walked around.  As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,471,4,12
55,"straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,472,4,12
55,"on the hard bricks.  It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,473,4,12

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,475,4,12
55,The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,476,4,12

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,504,4,13
55,"The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,505,4,13

55,only made day before yesterday.  What happened in the world before that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,507,4,13
55,"time is all unknown to me.  Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,508,4,13
55,"of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,509,4,13
55,"was going on.  There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,510,4,13
55,"I heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,511,4,13

55,"""'Now I'll make the eyes,'"" said the farmer.  So he painted my right",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,515,4,13
55,"eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,516,4,13
55,"at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,517,4,13
55,first glimpse of the world.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,518,4,14

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,520,4,14
55,"""'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'"" said the farmer.  And",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,521,4,14
55,when the second eye was done I could see much better than before.  Then,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,522,4,14
55,"he made my nose and my mouth.  But I did not speak, because at that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,523,4,14
55,time I didn't know what a mouth was for.  I had the fun of watching,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,524,4,14
55,them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,525,4,14
55,"head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,526,4,14

55,"tall stick, where you found me.  He and his friend soon after walked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,532,4,14
55,away and left me alone.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,533,4,14

55,"""I did not like to be deserted this way.  So I tried to walk after",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,534,4,14

55,"on that pole.  It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,536,4,14
55,"of, having been made such a little while before.  Many crows and other",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,537,4,14
55,"birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,538,4,14
55,"away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,539,4,14
55,feel that I was quite an important person.  By and by an old crow flew,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,540,4,14
55,"near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,541,4,14
55,and said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,542,4,14

55,"""'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,543,4,14

55,Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,545,4,14
55,"other birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,546,4,14

55,"brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,550,4,14

55,"little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,606,5,16
55,"her breakfast.  She saw there was not much bread left in the basket,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,607,5,16
55,"and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,608,5,16

55,come from behind them.  They turned and walked through the forest a few,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,615,5,16
55,"steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,616,5,16
55,that fell between the trees.  She ran to the place and then stopped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,617,5,16

55,"""Oil my neck, first,"" replied the Tin Woodman.  So she oiled it, and as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,636,5,17
55,it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,637,5,17
55,"moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,638,5,17
55,man could turn it himself.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,639,5,17
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,639,5,17
55,"""Now oil the joints in my arms,"" he said.  And Dorothy oiled them and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,640,5,17

55,and as good as new.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,642,5,17

55,"""This is a great comfort,"" he said.  ""I have been holding that axe in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,645,5,17

55,the following story:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,694,5,18
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,694,5,18
55,"""I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,695,5,18
55,"and sold the wood for a living.  When I grew up, I too became a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,696,5,18
55,"woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,697,5,18
55,long as she lived.  Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,698,5,18
55,"I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,699,5,18
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,699,5,18
55,"""There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,700,5,18
55,"grew to love her with all my heart.  She, on her part, promised to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,701,5,18
55,marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,702,5,18
55,for her; so I set to work harder than ever.  But the girl lived with an,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,703,5,19
55,"old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,704,5,19
55,wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,705,5,19
55,"housework.  So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,706,5,19
55,promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,707,5,19
55,"Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,708,5,19
55,"away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,709,5,19
55,"wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,710,5,19
55,left leg.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,711,5,19
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,711,5,19
55,"""This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,712,5,19
55,could not do very well as a wood-chopper.  So I went to a tinsmith and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,713,5,19
55,"had him make me a new leg out of tin.  The leg worked very well, once I",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,714,5,19
55,"was used to it.  But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,715,5,19
55,for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,716,5,19
55,"Munchkin girl.  When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,717,5,19
55,"my right leg.  Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,718,5,19
55,"out of tin.  After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,719,5,19
55,"the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,720,5,19
55,"The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,721,5,19
55,first I thought that was the end of me.  But the tinsmith happened to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,722,5,19
55,"come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,723,5,19
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,723,5,19
55,"""I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,724,5,19
55,ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be.  She thought of a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,725,5,19
55,"new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,726,5,19
55,"axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,727,5,19
55,two halves.  Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,728,5,19
55,"of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,729,5,19
55,"joints, so that I could move around as well as ever.  But, alas!  I had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,730,5,19
55,"now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,731,5,19
55,not care whether I married her or not.  I suppose she is still living,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,732,5,19
55,"with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,733,5,19
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,733,5,19
55,"""My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,734,5,19
55,"it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,735,5,19
55,There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,736,5,19
55,oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,737,5,19
55,"However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,738,5,19

55,"a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,741,5,20
55,time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,742,5,20
55,heart.  While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,743,5,20
55,"can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,744,5,20

55,"Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,793,6,21
55,"forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,794,6,21

55,shape again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,808,6,21

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,809,6,21
55,"""That's why he went over so easily,"" remarked the Lion.  ""It astonished",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,810,6,21

55,again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,813,6,21

55,"""That's why he nearly blunted my claws,"" said the Lion.  ""When they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,814,6,22

55,"is that little animal you are so tender of?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,816,6,22
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,816,6,22

55,"""Oh!  He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,820,6,22

55,"All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,826,6,22

55,that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,828,6,22
55,out of my way.  Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,829,6,22

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,864,6,23
55,"So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,865,6,23
55,walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side.  Toto did not approve of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,866,6,23
55,"this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,867,6,23
55,been crushed between the Lion's great jaws.  But after a time he became,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,868,6,23
55,"more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,869,6,23
55,good friends.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,870,6,23
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,870,6,23
55,During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,871,6,23
55,"peace of their journey.  Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,872,6,23
55,"beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,873,6,23
55,"thing.  This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,874,6,23
55,careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,875,6,23
55,several tears of sorrow and regret.  These tears ran slowly down his,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,876,6,23
55,"face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.  When",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,877,6,23
55,Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,878,6,23
55,"his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.  He became",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,879,6,23
55,greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,880,6,23
55,"him, but she could not understand.  The Lion was also puzzled to know",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,881,6,23
55,what was wrong.  But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,882,6,23
55,"basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,883,6,23
55,could talk as well as before.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,884,6,23
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,884,6,23
55,"""This will serve me a lesson,"" said he, ""to look where I step.  For if",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,885,6,23
55,"I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,886,6,23
55,"crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,887,6,23
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,887,6,23
55,"Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,888,6,24
55,"when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,889,6,24
55,"harm it.  The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,890,6,24
55,he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,891,6,24

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,895,7,24
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,895,7,24
55,They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,896,7,24
55,"forest, for there were no houses near.  The tree made a good, thick",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,897,7,24
55,"covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,898,7,24
55,great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,899,7,24
55,warmed her and made her feel less lonely.  She and Toto ate the last of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,900,7,24
55,"their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,901,7,24
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,901,7,24
55,"""If you wish,"" said the Lion, ""I will go into the forest and kill a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,902,7,24
55,"deer for you.  You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,903,7,24
55,"peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,904,7,24
55,"good breakfast.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,905,7,24
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,905,7,24
55,"""Don't!  Please don't,"" begged the Tin Woodman.  ""I should certainly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,906,7,24
55,"weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,907,7,24

55,"But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,908,7,24
55,"one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it.  And the Scarecrow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,909,7,24
55,"found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,910,7,24
55,that she would not be hungry for a long time.  She thought this was,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,911,7,24
55,"very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,912,7,24
55,the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts.  His,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,913,7,24
55,padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,914,7,24
55,almost as many as he put in the basket.  But the Scarecrow did not mind,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,915,7,24
55,"how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,916,7,24
55,"away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,917,7,24
55,"burn him up.  So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,918,7,24
55,came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,919,7,24
55,"These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,920,7,24
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,920,7,24
55,"When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,921,7,24
55,"brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,922,7,24
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,922,7,24
55,This was to be an eventful day for the travelers.  They had hardly been,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,923,7,24
55,walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,924,7,24
55,the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,925,7,25
55,"side.  It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,926,7,25
55,"looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,927,7,25
55,"many big, jagged rocks at the bottom.  The sides were so steep that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,928,7,25

55,"then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,960,7,25
55,"side.  The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,961,7,25
55,then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,962,7,26
55,"rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,963,7,26

55,The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,979,7,26
55,across the road.  But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,980,7,26
55,at once he could not leap across it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,981,7,26
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,981,7,26
55,"So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,982,7,26
55,thought the Scarecrow said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,983,7,26
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,983,7,26
55,"""Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch.  If the Tin Woodman",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,984,7,26
55,"can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,985,7,26
55,"across it easily.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,986,7,26
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,986,7,26
55,"""That is a first-rate idea,"" said the Lion.  ""One would almost suspect",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,987,7,26
55,"you had brains in your head, instead of straw.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,988,7,26
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,988,7,26
55,"The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,989,7,26
55,was soon chopped nearly through.  Then the Lion put his strong front,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,990,7,26
55,"legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,991,7,26
55,"tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,992,7,26
55,branches on the other side.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,993,7,26
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,993,7,26
55,They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,994,7,26
55,"made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,995,7,26
55,two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,996,7,26
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,996,7,26
55,"""They are the Kalidahs!"" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,997,7,26

55,"""Quick!"" cried the Scarecrow.  ""Let us cross over.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,998,7,26
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,998,7,26
55,"So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,999,7,27
55,"followed, and the Scarecrow came next.  The Lion, although he was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1000,7,27
55,"certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1001,7,27
55,and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1002,7,27
55,"backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1003,7,27
55,in surprise.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1004,7,27
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1004,7,27
55,"But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1005,7,27
55,"were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1006,7,27
55,"forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1007,7,27
55,would do next.  Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1008,7,27
55,began to cross the tree.  And the Lion said to Dorothy:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1009,7,27
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1009,7,27
55,"""We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1010,7,27

55,"am alive.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1012,7,27

55,"best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1014,7,27
55,the tree that rested on their side of the ditch.  The Tin Woodman began,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1015,7,27
55,"to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1016,7,27
55,"across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1017,7,27
55,"snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1018,7,27
55,rocks at the bottom.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1019,7,27

55,"we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1021,7,27
55,must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive.  Those creatures,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1022,7,27

55,This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1025,7,27
55,"the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1026,7,27
55,to ride on the Lion's back.  To their great joy the trees became,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1027,7,27
55,"thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1028,7,27
55,"came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them.  On the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1029,7,27
55,other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1030,7,27
55,"through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1031,7,27
55,flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1032,7,27
55,fruits.  They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1033,7,27
55,before them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1034,7,27
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1034,7,27
55,"""How shall we cross the river?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1035,7,27
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1035,7,27
55,"""That is easily done,"" replied the Scarecrow.  ""The Tin Woodman must",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1036,7,28
55,"build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1037,7,28
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1037,7,28
55,So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1038,7,28
55,"a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1039,7,28
55,"riverbank a tree full of fine fruit.  This pleased Dorothy, who had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1040,7,28
55,"eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1041,7,28
55,fruit.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1042,7,28
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1042,7,28
55,"But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1043,7,28
55,"untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1044,7,28
55,So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1045,7,28
55,"the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1046,7,28

55,Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1049,8,28
55,"full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1050,8,28
55,plums from the trees beside the river.  Behind them was the dark forest,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1051,8,28
55,"they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1052,8,28
55,"discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1053,8,28
55,seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1054,8,28
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1054,8,28
55,"To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1055,8,28
55,"But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1056,8,28
55,"more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1057,8,28
55,to start.  Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1058,8,28
55,her arms.  When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1059,8,28
55,"badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1060,8,28
55,"stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1061,8,28
55,hands to push the raft through the water.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1062,8,28
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1062,8,28
55,"They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1063,8,28
55,"the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1064,8,28
55,farther away from the road of yellow brick.  And the water grew so deep,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1065,8,28
55,that the long poles would not touch the bottom.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1066,8,28
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1066,8,28
55,"""This is bad,"" said the Tin Woodman, ""for if we cannot get to the land",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1067,8,28
55,"we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1068,8,28
55,"and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1069,8,28

55,"""And then I should get no brains,"" said the Scarecrow.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1070,8,28
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1070,8,28
55,"""And I should get no courage,"" said the Cowardly Lion.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1071,8,28

55,"""And I should get no heart,"" said the Tin Woodman.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1072,8,28

55,"""And I should never get back to Kansas,"" said Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1073,8,29
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1073,8,29
55,"""We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,"" the Scarecrow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1074,8,29
55,"continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1075,8,29
55,"the mud at the bottom of the river.  Then, before he could pull it out",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1076,8,29
55,"again--or let go--the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1077,8,29
55,clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1078,8,29
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1078,8,29
55,"""Good-bye!"" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1079,8,29
55,"him.  Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1080,8,29
55,"that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1081,8,29
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1081,8,29

55,"""I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,"" he thought.  ""Then,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1083,8,29
55,"I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1084,8,29
55,"the crows, at any rate.  But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1085,8,29
55,stuck on a pole in the middle of a river.  I am afraid I shall never,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1086,8,29
55,"have any brains, after all!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1087,8,29

55,behind.  Then the Lion said:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1089,8,29
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1089,8,29
55,"""Something must be done to save us.  I think I can swim to the shore",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1090,8,29

55,"tail.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1092,8,29

55,his tail.  Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1094,8,29
55,"shore.  It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1095,8,29
55,"were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1096,8,29
55,long pole and helped push the raft to the land.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1097,8,29
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1097,8,29
55,They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1098,8,29
55,"off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1099,8,29
55,carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1100,8,29
55,Emerald City.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1101,8,29
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1101,8,29

55,the grass to let the sun dry him.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1103,8,29
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1103,8,29

55,"started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1108,8,29
55,"carried them.  It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1109,8,29
55,"fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1110,8,30
55,"for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1111,8,30

55,"They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1167,8,31
55,and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1168,8,31
55,midst of a great meadow of poppies.  Now it is well known that when,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1169,8,31
55,there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1170,8,31
55,"anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1171,8,31
55,"away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever.  But",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1172,8,31
55,"Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1173,8,31
55,flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1174,8,31
55,and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1175,8,31
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1175,8,31

55,"""We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1177,8,31
55,he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him.  So they kept walking until,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1178,8,31
55,Dorothy could stand no longer.  Her eyes closed in spite of herself and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1179,8,31
55,"she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1180,8,31
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1180,8,31
55,"""What shall we do?"" asked the Tin Woodman.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1181,8,31
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1181,8,31
55,"""If we leave her here she will die,"" said the Lion.  ""The smell of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1182,8,31

55,"Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1186,8,32
55,troubled by the scent of the flowers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1187,8,32

55,"""Run fast,"" said the Scarecrow to the Lion, ""and get out of this deadly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1188,8,32

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1192,8,32
55,"""Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,"" said the Scarecrow.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1193,8,32
55,"So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1194,8,32
55,made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1195,8,32
55,and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1196,8,32

55,"On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1197,8,32

55,"of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1199,8,32
55,asleep among the poppies.  The flowers had been too strong for the huge,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1200,8,32

55,"The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1217,9,32
55,turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1218,9,32
55,"beast come bounding over the grass toward them.  It was, indeed, a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1219,9,32
55,"great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1220,9,32
55,"something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1221,9,33
55,"wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1222,9,33
55,like balls of fire.  As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1223,9,33
55,"before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1224,9,33

55,"pretty, harmless creature.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1226,9,33
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1226,9,33
55,"So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1227,9,33

55,rolled over at his feet in two pieces.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1229,9,33
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1229,9,33
55,"The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1230,9,33

55,"Queen--the Queen of all the Field Mice!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1237,9,33

55,"scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1251,9,33
55,seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1252,9,33
55,right into the middle of the group.  Toto had always loved to chase,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1253,9,33
55,"mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1254,9,33
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1254,9,33
55,"But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1255,9,33

55,"hurt you.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1257,9,33

55,"made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1290,9,34
55,the leaves and branches.  He fastened it together with wooden pegs and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1291,9,34

55,and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1293,9,34

55,mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1296,9,35
55,piece of string in his mouth.  It was about this time that Dorothy woke,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1297,9,35
55,from her long sleep and opened her eyes.  She was greatly astonished to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1298,9,35
55,"find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1299,9,35
55,around and looking at her timidly.  But the Scarecrow told her about,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1300,9,35

55,tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck.  Of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1307,9,35
55,course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1308,9,35

55,"fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1321,9,35
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1321,9,35
55,Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1322,9,35

55,through the grass to their homes.  The Queen of the Mice was the last,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1326,9,35
55,to leave.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1327,9,35

55,"the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1352,10,36
55,of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1353,10,36
55,Great Oz dwelt.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1354,10,36
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1354,10,36
55,"The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1355,10,36
55,"beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1356,10,36
55,"behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1357,10,36
55,Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1358,10,36
55,"painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1359,10,36
55,"evidently lived, that also was painted green.  They passed by several",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1360,10,36
55,"of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1361,10,36
55,doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1362,10,36
55,"one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1363,10,36
55,which they were very much afraid.  The people were all dressed in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1364,10,36
55,clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1365,10,36
55,those of the Munchkins.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1366,10,36
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1366,10,36

55,"""Yes,"" answered the Scarecrow.  ""Everything is green here, while in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1369,10,37
55,country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color.  But the people,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1370,10,37
55,"do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1371,10,37

55,"the people.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1375,10,37
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1375,10,37

55,to the door and knocked.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1377,10,37
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1377,10,37
55,"A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, ""What do you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1378,10,37

55,"more afraid of you than you are of him.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1385,10,37
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1385,10,37
55,"""Well,"" said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1386,10,37

55,"So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1389,10,37
55,"children and a man.  The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1390,10,37
55,couch in a corner.  They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1391,10,37

55,"he looks like a cat.  To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1408,10,38

55,"The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1437,10,38

55,"As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1448,10,39
55,seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels.  Yet it,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1449,10,39
55,was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1450,10,39

55,"He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1460,10,39

55,"curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1476,10,39

55,"fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1490,10,40
55,were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1491,10,40
55,"Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck.  When they were on, Dorothy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1492,10,40

55,The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1505,11,40

55,"pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1507,11,40
55,"together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1508,11,40
55,brightness of the sun.  The window panes were of green glass; even the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1509,11,40

55,with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1533,11,41
55,soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1534,11,41
55,"this room, and when they were seated he said politely:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1535,11,41
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1535,11,41

55,"They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned.  When, at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1538,11,41
55,"last, he came back, Dorothy asked:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1539,11,41
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1539,11,41
55,"""Have you seen Oz?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1540,11,41
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1540,11,41
55,"""Oh, no,"" returned the soldier; ""I have never seen him.  But I spoke to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1541,11,41
55,him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message.  He said he,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1542,11,41
55,"will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1543,11,41
55,"enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1544,11,41
55,"Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1545,11,41
55,have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1546,11,41
55,"journey.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1547,11,41

55,"The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1549,11,41
55,"dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room.  She had lovely",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1550,11,41
55,"green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1551,11,41
55,"said, ""Follow me and I will show you your room.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1552,11,41
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1552,11,41
55,"So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1553,11,41
55,dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1554,11,42
55,three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1555,11,42
55,"Palace.  It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1556,11,42
55,comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1557,11,42
55,"counterpane.  There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1558,11,42
55,"shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1559,11,42
55,beautifully carved green marble basin.  Beautiful green flowers stood,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1560,11,42
55,"in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1561,11,42
55,When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1562,11,42
55,"green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1563,11,42
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1563,11,42
55,"In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1564,11,42
55,velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1565,11,42
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1565,11,42
55,"""Make yourself perfectly at home,"" said the green girl, ""and if you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1566,11,42

55,"morning.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1568,11,42
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1568,11,42
55,She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others.  These she also led,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1569,11,42
55,"to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1570,11,42
55,part of the Palace.  Of course this politeness was wasted on the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1571,11,42
55,Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1572,11,42
55,"stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1573,11,42
55,"It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1574,11,42
55,he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1575,11,42
55,"web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1576,11,42
55,wonderful rooms in the world.  The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1577,11,42
55,"force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1578,11,42
55,"being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1579,11,42
55,to make sure they kept in good working order.  The Lion would have,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1580,11,42
55,"preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1581,11,42
55,"shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1582,11,42
55,he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1583,11,42
55,himself asleep in a minute.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1584,11,42
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1584,11,42
55,"The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1585,11,42
55,"Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1586,11,42
55,green brocaded satin.  Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1587,11,42
55,"green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1588,11,42
55,of the Great Oz.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1589,11,42
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1589,11,42
55,First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1590,11,42
55,"of the court, all dressed in rich costumes.  These people had nothing",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1591,11,43
55,"to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1592,11,43
55,"Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1593,11,43
55,"Oz.  As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1594,11,43
55,whispered:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1595,11,43

55,"""Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1596,11,43

55,"the Wizard, ""although he does not like to have people ask to see him.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1599,11,43
55,"Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1600,11,43
55,"came from.  Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1601,11,43
55,your silver shoes he was very much interested.  At last I told him,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1602,11,43
55,"about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1603,11,43
55,"his presence.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1604,11,43
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1604,11,43
55,"Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, ""That is the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1605,11,43
55,"signal.  You must go into the Throne Room alone.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1606,11,43
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1606,11,43
55,She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1607,11,43
55,"herself in a wonderful place.  It was a big, round room with a high",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1608,11,43
55,"arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1609,11,43
55,large emeralds set closely together.  In the center of the roof was a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1610,11,43
55,"great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1611,11,43
55,wonderful manner.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1612,11,43
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1612,11,43
55,But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1613,11,43
55,that stood in the middle of the room.  It was shaped like a chair and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1614,11,43
55,"sparkled with gems, as did everything else.  In the center of the chair",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1615,11,43
55,"was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1616,11,43
55,"whatever.  There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1617,11,43
55,"and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1618,11,43
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1618,11,43
55,"As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1619,11,43
55,"and looked at her sharply and steadily.  Then the mouth moved, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1620,11,43
55,Dorothy heard a voice say:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1621,11,43

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1622,11,43
55,It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1623,11,43
55,Head; so she took courage and answered:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1624,11,43
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1624,11,43
55,"""I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek.  I have come to you for help.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1625,11,43

55,"Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1634,11,44

55,"the Scarecrow twisted its neck also.  There were forty crows, and forty",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1900,12,51
55,"times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1901,12,51

55,"""Go to the strangers and sting them to death!"" commanded the Witch, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1909,12,51
55,the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1910,12,51
55,"her friends were walking.  But the Woodman had seen them coming, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1911,12,51
55,the Scarecrow had decided what to do.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1912,12,51
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1912,12,51
55,"""Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1913,12,51

55,"This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1915,12,51
55,"Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1916,12,51
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1916,12,51
55,"The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1917,12,51
55,"at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1918,12,51
55,the Woodman at all.  And as bees cannot live when their stings are,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1919,12,51
55,"broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1920,12,51
55,"about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1921,12,51
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1921,12,51
55,"Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1922,12,51
55,"put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1923,12,51
55,ever.  So they started upon their journey once more.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1924,12,52
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1924,12,52
55,The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1925,12,52
55,heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1926,12,52
55,"gnashed her teeth.  And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1927,12,52
55,"the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1928,12,52
55,strangers and destroy them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1929,12,52
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1929,12,52
55,"The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1930,12,52
55,told.  So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy.  Then the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1931,12,52
55,"Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1932,12,52
55,were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1933,12,52
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1933,12,52
55,When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1934,12,52
55,"strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1935,12,52
55,think what she should do next.  She could not understand how all her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1936,12,52
55,plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1937,12,52
55,"Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1938,12,52
55,act.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1939,12,52
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1939,12,52
55,"There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1940,12,52
55,rubies running round it.  This Golden Cap had a charm.  Whoever owned,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1941,12,52
55,"it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1942,12,52
55,order they were given.  But no person could command these strange,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1943,12,52
55,creatures more than three times.  Twice already the Wicked Witch had,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1944,12,52
55,used the charm of the Cap.  Once was when she had made the Winkies her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1945,12,52
55,"slaves, and set herself to rule over their country.  The Winged Monkeys",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1946,12,52
55,had helped her do this.  The second time was when she had fought,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1947,12,52
55,"against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1948,12,52
55,West.  The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this.  Only once,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1949,12,52
55,"more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1950,12,52
55,to do so until all her other powers were exhausted.  But now that her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1951,12,52
55,"fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1952,12,52
55,"her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1953,12,52
55,only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1954,12,52
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1954,12,52
55,So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1955,12,52
55,upon her head.  Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1956,12,52

55,"""Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1957,12,52

55,"Now the charm began to work.  The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1962,12,53
55,"sound was heard in the air.  There was a rushing of many wings, a great",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1963,12,53
55,"chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1964,12,53
55,"the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1965,12,53

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1966,12,53
55,"One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader.  He flew",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1967,12,53
55,"close to the Witch and said, ""You have called us for the third and last",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1968,12,53

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1969,12,53
55,"""Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1970,12,53

55,"a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1972,12,53
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1972,12,53
55,"""Your commands shall be obeyed,"" said the leader.  Then, with a great",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1973,12,53
55,"deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1974,12,53
55,where Dorothy and her friends were walking.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1975,12,53
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1975,12,53
55,Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1976,12,53
55,air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1977,12,53
55,"Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1978,12,53
55,"rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1979,12,53
55,nor groan.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1980,12,53
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1980,12,53
55,"Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1981,12,53
55,pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head.  They made his hat,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1982,12,53
55,and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1983,12,53
55,branches of a tall tree.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1984,12,53
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1984,12,53
55,The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1985,12,53
55,"wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1986,12,53
55,to bite or scratch or struggle in any way.  Then they lifted him up and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1987,12,53
55,"flew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1988,12,53
55,"small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1989,12,53
55,escape.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1990,12,53
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1990,12,53
55,"But Dorothy they did not harm at all.  She stood, with Toto in her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1991,12,53
55,"arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1992,12,53
55,"be her turn.  The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1993,12,53
55,"long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1994,12,53
55,he saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1995,12,53
55,"short, motioning the others not to touch her.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1996,12,53
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1996,12,53
55,"""We dare not harm this little girl,"" he said to them, ""for she is",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1997,12,53
55,"protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1998,12,54

55,"and leave her there.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2000,12,54

55,"her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2002,12,54
55,set her down upon the front doorstep.  Then the leader said to the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2003,12,54

55,"Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2009,12,54
55,"noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2010,12,54
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2010,12,54
55,The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2011,12,54
55,"on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2012,12,54
55,"Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way.  She looked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2013,12,54
55,"down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2014,12,54
55,"with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them.  At",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2015,12,54
55,first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2016,12,54
55,to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2017,12,54
55,"was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2018,12,54
55,"Silver Shoes gave her.  So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2019,12,54
55,"thought, ""I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2020,12,54
55,"use her power."" Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2021,12,54

55,"""Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2022,12,54

55,"Scarecrow.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2024,12,54
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2024,12,54
55,Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2025,12,54
55,"until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2026,12,54
55,and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2027,12,54
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2027,12,54
55,"Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2028,12,54
55,she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2029,12,54
55,her.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2030,12,54
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2030,12,54
55,"With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2031,12,54
55,courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2032,12,54
55,"her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2033,12,54
55,go to drive.  But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2034,12,54
55,"bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2035,12,55
55,shut the gate again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2036,12,55
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2036,12,55
55,"""If I cannot harness you,"" said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2037,12,55
55,"the bars of the gate, ""I can starve you.  You shall have nothing to eat",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2038,12,55
55,"until you do as I wish.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2039,12,55

55,"you.""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2044,12,55
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2044,12,55
55,The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2045,12,55
55,"every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2046,12,55
55,the cupboard.  After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2047,12,55
55,"straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2048,12,55
55,"shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2049,12,55
55,"way to escape.  But they could find no way to get out of the castle,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2050,12,55
55,"for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2051,12,55
55,slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2052,12,55
55,them.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2053,12,55
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2053,12,55
55,"The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2054,12,55
55,threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2055,12,55
55,"her hand.  But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2056,12,55
55,"of the mark upon her forehead.  The child did not know this, and was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2057,12,55
55,full of fear for herself and Toto.  Once the Witch struck Toto a blow,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2058,12,55
55,with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2059,12,55
55,"in return.  The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2060,12,55
55,so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2061,12,55
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2061,12,55
55,Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2062,12,55
55,be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again.  Sometimes,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2063,12,55
55,"she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2064,12,55
55,"looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2065,12,55
55,his little mistress.  Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2066,12,55
55,or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2067,12,55
55,"little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2068,12,55
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2068,12,55
55,Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2069,12,55
55,Shoes which the girl always wore.  Her bees and her crows and her,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2070,12,55
55,"wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2071,12,55
55,power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2072,12,56
55,"Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2073,12,56
55,"lost.  She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2074,12,56
55,"shoes, thinking she might steal them.  But the child was so proud of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2075,12,56
55,her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2076,12,56
55,she took her bath.  The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2077,12,56
55,"go in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2078,12,56
55,"was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2079,12,56
55,"Dorothy was bathing.  Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2080,12,56
55,ever let water touch her in any way.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2081,12,56
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2081,12,56
55,"But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2082,12,56
55,trick that would give her what she wanted.  She placed a bar of iron in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2083,12,56
55,"the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2084,12,56
55,iron invisible to human eyes.  So that when Dorothy walked across the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2085,12,56
55,"floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2086,12,56
55,"full length.  She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2087,12,56
55,"Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2088,12,56
55,it away and put it on her own skinny foot.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2089,12,56
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2089,12,56
55,"The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2090,12,56

55,to do so.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2093,12,56

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2095,12,56

55,"that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2121,12,57
55,of water and threw it over the mess.  She then swept it all out the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2122,12,57

55,"of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2124,12,57

55,"been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2131,13,57
55,"of his prison and set him free.  They went in together to the castle,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2132,13,57

55,them that they were no longer slaves.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2134,13,57
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2134,13,57
55,"There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2135,13,57
55,"made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2136,13,57
55,always treated them with great cruelty.  They kept this day as a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2137,13,57

55,"""We can try,"" answered the Lion.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2143,13,57
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2143,13,57
55,So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2144,13,57
55,"rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2145,13,57
55,"to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2146,13,58
55,bondage.  So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2147,13,58
55,"knew the most, and they all started away.  They traveled that day and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2148,13,58
55,part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2149,13,58
55,"Woodman lay, all battered and bent.  His axe was near him, but the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2150,13,58

55,"sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2154,13,58
55,When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2155,13,58

55,The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2162,13,58
55,they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.  So,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2163,13,58
55,they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2164,13,58
55,"worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2165,13,58
55,bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2166,13,58
55,"and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2167,13,58
55,"his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever.  To be sure, there",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2168,13,58
55,"were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2169,13,58
55,the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2170,13,58

55,"had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2173,13,58
55,joints would not be rusted.  At the same time her own tears fell thick,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2174,13,58
55,"and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2175,13,58
55,"did not need to be wiped away.  As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2176,13,58
55,"often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2177,13,58

55,"solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2192,13,59

55,fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2197,13,59
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2197,13,59

55,"and bade them good-bye.  The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2213,13,59
55,they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2214,13,59
55,and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West.  Finding they were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2215,13,59
55,"determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2216,13,59
55,collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2217,13,59
55,"diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2218,13,59
55,to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2219,13,59

55,You will remember there was no road--not even a pathway--between the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2232,14,60
55,castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City.  When the four,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2233,14,60
55,"travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2234,14,60
55,sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her.  It was much harder to,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2235,14,60
55,find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2236,14,60
55,"daisies than it was being carried.  They knew, of course, they must go",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2237,14,60
55,"straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2238,14,60
55,"way.  But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2239,14,60

55,"lost in the great fields.  They kept on walking, however, and at night",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2241,14,60
55,the moon came out and shone brightly.  So they lay down among the sweet,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2242,14,60

55,"people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good.  Her name",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2332,14,63
55,"was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2333,14,63
55,"blocks of ruby.  Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2334,14,63
55,"she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2335,14,63
55,"too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise.  At last,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2336,14,63
55,"however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2337,14,63

55,all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2340,14,63
55,"woman could wish.  When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2341,14,63

55,"purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2350,14,63
55,"do.  At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2351,14,63

55,"laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2357,14,63

55,"left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2979,17,80
55,the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost.  So they,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2980,17,80
55,looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2981,17,80
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2981,17,80
55,"The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2982,17,80
55,such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2983,17,80
55,"underneath.  So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2984,17,80
55,"under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2985,17,80
55,next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2986,17,80
55,fellow travelers.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2987,17,80
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2987,17,80
55,"This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2988,17,80
55,rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2989,17,80
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2989,17,80
55,"""Here is another space between the trees,"" called the Lion.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2990,17,80
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2990,17,80
55,"""Let me try it first,"" said the Scarecrow, ""for it doesn't hurt me to",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2991,17,80
55,"get thrown about.""  He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2992,17,80
55,branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2993,17,80
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2993,17,80
55,"""This is strange,"" exclaimed Dorothy.  ""What shall we do?""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2994,17,80
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2994,17,80
55,"""The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2995,17,80

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2996,17,80
55,"""I believe I will try it myself,"" said the Woodman, and shouldering his",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2997,17,81
55,"axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2998,17,81
55,roughly.  When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,2999,17,81
55,at it so fiercely that he cut it in two.  At once the tree began,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3000,17,81
55,"shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3001,17,81
55,safely under it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3002,17,81
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3002,17,81
55,"""Come on!"" he shouted to the others.  ""Be quick!""  They all ran forward",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3003,17,81
55,"and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3004,17,81
55,by a small branch and shaken until he howled.  But the Woodman promptly,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3005,17,81
55,chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3006,17,81
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3006,17,81
55,"The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3007,17,81
55,made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3008,17,81
55,"their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3009,17,81
55,"forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3010,17,81
55,of it.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3011,17,81
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3011,17,81
55,The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3012,17,81
55,"to the farther edge of the wood.  Then, to their surprise, they found",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3013,17,81
55,before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china.  It was,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3014,17,81

55,While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3020,18,81

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3022,18,81

55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3027,18,81
55,"After a time the ladder was finished.  It looked clumsy, but the Tin",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3028,18,81
55,Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose.  The,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3029,18,81
55,"Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3030,18,81
55,"ladder was ready.  The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3031,18,81
55,was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3032,18,81
55,from falling off.  When he got his head over the top of the wall the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3033,18,81
55,"Scarecrow said, ""Oh, my!""",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3034,18,82

55,"""Go on,"" exclaimed Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3035,18,82
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3035,18,82
55,So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3036,18,82

55,Scarecrow had done.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3038,18,82
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3038,18,82

55,"The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3041,18,82

55,"When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3043,18,82
55,down and saw a strange sight.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3044,18,82
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3044,18,82
55,Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3045,18,82
55,shining and white as the bottom of a big platter.  Scattered around,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3046,18,82
55,were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3047,18,82
55,"colors.  These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3048,18,82
55,"only as high as Dorothy's waist.  There were also pretty little barns,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3049,18,82
55,with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3050,18,82
55,"pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3051,18,82
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3051,18,82
55,But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3052,18,82
55,"country.  There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3053,18,82
55,bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3054,18,82
55,gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3055,18,82
55,"knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3056,18,82
55,golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3057,18,82
55,"their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3058,18,82
55,"in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3059,18,82
55,"pointed caps.  And, strangest of all, these people were all made of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3060,18,82
55,"china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3061,18,82
55,them was no higher than Dorothy's knee.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3062,18,82
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3062,18,82
55,"No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3063,18,82
55,"purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3064,18,82
55,"barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3065,18,82
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3065,18,82
55,"""How shall we get down?"" asked Dorothy.",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3066,18,82
55,,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3066,18,82
55,"They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3067,18,82
55,Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3068,18,82
55,the hard floor would not hurt their feet.  Of course they took pains,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3069,18,82
55,not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet.  When all were,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3070,18,82
55,"safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3071,18,83

55,first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow.  As,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3077,18,83
55,"they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3078,18,83

55,"""There!"" cried the milkmaid angrily.  ""See what you have done!  My cow",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3084,18,83
55,"has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3085,18,83

55,But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer.  She,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3089,18,83
55,"picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3090,18,83
55,on three legs.  As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3091,18,83
55,"glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3092,18,83
55,elbow close to her side.,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3093,18,83

55,"in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3164,19,85
55,"tall, rank grass.  It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3165,19,85

55,"However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3167,19,85

55,"When morning came, they started again.  Before they had gone far they",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3185,19,86

55,"were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3225,19,87
55,"coarse black hair.  It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a",The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3226,19,87
55,foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,3227,19,87
